        <h2>YOUR DECISIONS MATTER! </h2>
        <p>
          There are many little changes you can make to how you live your life
          to take a stand against the destruction of our world. Start with the
          little things you purcahse for your diet,everyday supplies and
          clothing!For instance switch from cow's milk to non-dairy milks like
          soy or oat milk, etc. which the production of causes a lot of
          greenhouse gas emissions, water degradation, and loss of natural
          habitats. Support your local farmers' markets and small businesses
          instead of big corporations or brands that are contributing to the
          harm being done to the environment. Most importantly is to shop
          condiderably; think again when making a purchase and keep questions
          like:"Do I need this?","If the packaging is made out of plastic,are
          there any alternitive?","Do you stand by the values of the campany
          that you are purchasing from?","Cound you possibly get the product secondhanded?" etc.
